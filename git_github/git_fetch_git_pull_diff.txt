-> What is the difference between below?

1. `git fetch origin develp`

VS

2. `git pull origin develop`
   `git rebase`

==============================================================


⏺ You should use git fetch origin develop + git rebase origin/develop - this is the correct and better approach.

  Here's why:

  ❌ git pull origin develop + git rebase - WRONG

  git pull origin develop    # This fetches AND merges develop into your branch
  git rebase                 # Now you're trying to rebase after already merging - confusing!
  This doesn't make sense because:
  - git pull already merged develop into your branch
  - Then you're trying to rebase, but you already have a merge commit
  - Results in a messy, confusing history

  ✅ git fetch origin develop + git rebase origin/develop - CORRECT

  git fetch origin develop          # Download latest develop, don't merge yet
  git rebase origin/develop         # Replay your commits on top of develop
  This is the proper workflow because:
  - Fetch downloads the changes without touching your branch
  - Rebase replays your feature commits on top of the latest develop
  - Creates clean, linear history
  - This is the standard workflow for syncing with rebase

  Common Shortcut

  You can also use:
  git pull --rebase origin develop
  This is equivalent to git fetch origin develop + git rebase origin/develop in one command.

  Summary

  - For syncing with rebase: git fetch + git rebase ✅
  - For syncing with merge: git pull (or git fetch + git merge) ✅
  - Don't mix: git pull + git rebase ❌

==============================================================


⏺ Great question! Let me explain the key differences between these two approaches:

  1. git fetch origin develop

  - Only downloads the latest changes from the remote develop branch
  - Does NOT merge anything into your current branch
  - Updates your local reference to origin/develop
  - Your working directory remains unchanged
  - You can then choose how to integrate the changes (merge, rebase, or just inspect)

  2. git pull origin develop + git rebase

  - git pull origin develop = git fetch origin develop + git merge origin/develop
  - This fetches AND merges develop into your current branch in one step
  - Creates a merge commit (unless fast-forward)
  - If you then do git rebase, you're trying to rebase after already merging (usually not the intended workflow)

  What I Actually Did vs. What You Might Want

  What I did earlier:
  git fetch origin develop
  git merge origin/develop
  This created a merge commit showing where develop was integrated into your feature branch.

  Alternative approach (cleaner history):
  git fetch origin develop
  git rebase origin/develop
  This would replay your commits on top of develop, creating a linear history without merge commits.

  Key Differences: Merge vs. Rebase

  Merge (what I did):
  - ✅ Preserves complete history
  - ✅ Shows when branches diverged and merged
  - ❌ Creates extra merge commits
  - Branch history: A - B - C - D - [merge commit]

  Rebase:
  - ✅ Creates clean, linear history
  - ✅ No merge commits
  - ❌ Rewrites commit history (requires force push if already pushed)
  - Branch history: A - B - C - D - E - F (linear)

1. git fetch origin devlop

VS

2. git pull origin develop
   git rebase

==============================================================



⏺ Great question! Let me explain the key differences between these two approaches:

  1. git fetch origin develop

  - Only downloads the latest changes from the remote develop branch
  - Does NOT merge anything into your current branch
  - Updates your local reference to origin/develop
  - Your working directory remains unchanged
  - You can then choose how to integrate the changes (merge, rebase, or just inspect)

  2. git pull origin develop + git rebase

  - git pull origin develop = git fetch origin develop + git merge origin/develop
  - This fetches AND merges develop into your current branch in one step
  - Creates a merge commit (unless fast-forward)
  - If you then do git rebase, you're trying to rebase after already merging (usually not the intended workflow)

  What I Actually Did vs. What You Might Want

  What I did earlier:
  git fetch origin develop
  git merge origin/develop
  This created a merge commit showing where develop was integrated into your feature branch.

  Alternative approach (cleaner history):
  git fetch origin develop
  git rebase origin/develop
  This would replay your commits on top of develop, creating a linear history without merge commits.

  Key Differences: Merge vs. Rebase

  Merge (what I did):
  - ✅ Preserves complete history
  - ✅ Shows when branches diverged and merged
  - ❌ Creates extra merge commits
  - Branch history: A - B - C - D - [merge commit]

  Rebase:
  - ✅ Creates clean, linear history
  - ✅ No merge commits
  - ❌ Rewrites commit history (requires force push if already pushed)
  - Branch history: A - B - C - D - E - F (linear)

  Would you like me to redo the sync using rebase instead for a cleaner history?
